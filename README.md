# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
I have applied basic to intermediate python skills along with basic Pandas, Numpy to data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.   

Based on some analyses, It is believed that the average duration of movies has been declining.As evidence of this, we were provided with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. In this project, we have done some manipulation to convert raw data to usable data applying basic Pandas, Numpy skiils and visualize the data using Matplotlib.
